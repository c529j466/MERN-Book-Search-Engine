# MERN-Book-Search-Engine

## Description


For this project, I was tasked with updating a book search engine app to use graphql mutations and queries for both backend and frontend functionality. The project uses graphql, the apollo server, and PWA fundementals to improve the app.The project functioned in that a user can create an account, search for books with a list of books fitting their search appearing, users can save books, and users can delete saved books. My motivation to complete this project was to better understand Graphql and the Apollo server and how they can be used to create queries and mutations. I also wanted to improve my knowledge on how a MERN stack works together to create a better functioning app. Along with this, I also wanted to further my knowledge on to apply react on the frontend of my apps.

## Installation

For a user to install this app, they would need to clone my repository to their local system, run npm install, run npm build, and then run npm develop to run the app on their local host. In addition, the app is deployed on Heroku with a link below.
